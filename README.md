# maqueen
micro:bit python library for the DFRobot Maqueen

To make some summmer holiday fun for a small group of kids with a few Maqueen robots.
We needed a simple microbit interface for programming with python.
And we needed it to run offline on linux, windows and mac.

The interface is implemented in 
- maqueen.py

It supports:
- motors
- servo motors
- red leds
- RGB leds
- ultrasound measurement in cm.

Please see the example py files to learn how each function is used.

- robot_motor.py
- robot_led.py
- robot_rgb.py
- robot_ultrasound.py
- robot_servos.py

The Mu editor was used for coding.
The maqueen.py was copied from the Mu folder to the micro:bit using the editor Files menu item.
The example py files was programmed using the Flash menu item.

Have fun!
